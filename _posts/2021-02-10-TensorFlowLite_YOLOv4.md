# TensorFlowLite YOLOv4

Modified TFLite Yolov4 detector for Thesis's purposes at my campus HTW Berlin

DISCLAIMER: I used the GitHub repository which is very similar to the repository TheAIGuysCode: yolov4-custom-functions, to add a new feature to be implemented with my custom YOLOv4-tiny model, and they may worsen the overal speed of the application and make it not optimized in respect to time complexity.
